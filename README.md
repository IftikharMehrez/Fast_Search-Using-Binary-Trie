# Fast_Search-Using-Binary-Trie

 1.) Implement a program that can do fast search on words in a dictionary. The dictionary will be stored in a data structure called Trie, where each node (except the root node) is a letter from English alphabet and any word can be read by following the path from root to a node (not necessarily a leaf node). 

 2.) Dictionary file contains n + 1 lines, where the first line contains the number of words in the dictionary. Then the next n lines contains words one by one.

 3.) Input file contains n + 1 lines, where the first line contains the number of test cases n. Then the next n lines contain test cases one by one. Each line contains two items separated via space. First item is the operator to be applied. It is either search or prefix. Second is the string to be searched or the prefix to be searched.
